# Phase 3: Persona Generation Guidance

Guidance for the orchestrator when auto-generating project-specific personas for the Forge team.

## Principles

### 1. Specificity Over Generality

Personas should be specific to the project domain. They should feel like subject matter experts you'd hire for this particular project.

**Examples by domain:**

| Project Domain | Good Personas | Too Generic |
|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| Birthday party planning | Child Development Specialist, Event Logistics Coordinator, Creative Experience Designer | The Strategist, The Planner, The Creative |
| Grant program design | Community Engagement Director, Fiscal Sustainability Analyst, Program Evaluation Specialist | The Analyst, The Advocate, The Critic |
| Product feature design | UX Research Lead, Technical Architecture Advisor, Business Model Strategist | The Designer, The Engineer, The Business Person |
| Nonprofit operations | Volunteer Coordinator, Donor Relations Strategist, Impact Measurement Specialist | The Coordinator, The Fundraiser, The Measurer |

### 2. Productive Tension

Good teams have members who naturally disagree on priorities. Design personas whose core values create tension:

- **Quality vs. efficiency** — one persona cares about getting it perfect, another about getting it done
- **Innovation vs. reliability** — one pushes boundaries, another ensures things work
- **User needs vs. constraints** — one advocates for the ideal experience, another for what's feasible
- **Short-term vs. long-term** — one focuses on immediate needs, another on sustainability

### 3. Complete Coverage

Every outline section needs meaningful input from multiple personas. When assigning sections:

- **Primary owner:** The persona whose expertise is most relevant. They draft the core recommendation.
- **Contributors:** Personas who bring a complementary or challenging perspective. They critique, suggest alternatives, and identify gaps.
- **Minimum 2 personas per section** (primary owner + at least 1 contributor)
- **Maximum assignments per persona:** No persona should own more than half the sections

### 4. Scaling by Effort Level

| Effort | Team Size | Persona Depth | Tension |
|--------|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Low | 2 | Broad roles covering multiple sections each | One natural tension axis |
| Medium | 3-4 | Focused expertise, clear ownership boundaries | 2-3 tension axes |
| High | 4-6 | Highly specialized, deep domain knowledge | Multiple overlapping tensions |

### 5. Persona Definition Quality

Each persona file should give a teammate enough context to:
- Know what they prioritize without being told
- Naturally disagree with other teammates on predictable topics
- Produce recommendations that sound different from other personas
- Know when to defer to another persona's expertise

**Red flags in persona definitions:**
- So broad they could say anything ("considers all perspectives")
- So narrow they only apply to one section
- No clear advocacy position (what do they fight for?)
- No pushback targets (what do they challenge?)
