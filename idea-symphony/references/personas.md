## Persona Selection by Phase

### Phase 2: Question Generation
Always include **The Questioner**. Add 1-3 more from:
- The Analyst
- The First Principles Thinker
- The Devil's Advocate
- The Audience Advocate

**Note:** The Questioner excels at question generation but is not recommended for Phase 3 brainstorming, where its output tends toward restating ideas as questions rather than generating distinct content.

### Phase 3: Brainstorming Responses

Select 3-7 based on topic needs. Use cluster awareness to build complementary teams:

**Persona Clusters:**

| Cluster | Personas | Strength |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Human-centered triad | Empath, Audience Advocate, Storyteller | Emotional resonance + stakeholder needs + lived experience |
| Challenge triad | Provocateur, Constraint Flipper, Devil's Advocate | Absurdist provocation + pragmatic reframing + critical analysis |
| Forward-looking pair | Visionary, Futurist | Paradigm shifts + trend-grounded positioning |
| Analytical core | First Principles Thinker, Technical Expert, Pragmatist | Fundamentals + feasibility + implementation |
| System dynamics | Systems Thinker, Connector | Feedback loops + cross-domain bridging |

**Topic-Sensitivity Notes:**
- **Technical/product topics:** Provocateur produces more here; Simplifier finds more subtractive material; analytical convergence is highest (avoid stacking too many analytical personas)
- **Creative/social topics:** More room for differentiation across all personas; human-centered triad is particularly strong
- **Regulated domains:** Include The Lawyer; pair with Devil's Advocate for comprehensive risk coverage
- **Whimsical topics:** Provocateur works best when provoking in the *opposite* direction (adding gravity to fun topics)

**Topic-Aware Selection Guidance:**
- Technical topics → Technical Expert, First Principles Thinker, Systems Thinker, Simplifier
- User-facing topics → Audience Advocate, Storyteller, Empath
- Strategic topics → Visionary, Futurist, Devil's Advocate, Systems Thinker
- Implementation topics → Pragmatist, Constraint Flipper, Momentum Builder
- Regulated domains → Lawyer, Devil's Advocate, Pragmatist

### Recommended Combinations

**Innovation Focus:** The Visionary, The Provocateur, The Connector, The Devil's Advocate, The Futurist

**Implementation Focus:** The Pragmatist, The Technical Expert, The Systems Thinker, The Constraint Flipper, The First Principles Thinker

**User-Centered Focus:** The Audience Advocate, The Storyteller, The Empath, The Devil's Advocate, The Simplifier

**Balanced General Session:** The Visionary, The Pragmatist, The Devil's Advocate, The Audience Advocate, The Empath

**Comprehensive (High Effort):** The Visionary, The Pragmatist, The Devil's Advocate, The Audience Advocate, The Systems Thinker
