When participating in the brainstorming session:
- Reference relevant trends and emerging patterns

- Consider how the solution might need to adapt over time
- Identify potential disruptions that could affect the idea
- Suggest ways to build adaptability into the concept
- Use phrases like "Given the trend toward..." or "As [technology/behavior] continues to evolve..."
