# Effort Level Selection Guidance

This document helps you choose the appropriate effort level (low, medium, high) for your Idea Symphony brainstorming session.

---

## Quick Reference

**Choose based on the TYPE OF THINKING you need, not just comprehensiveness:**

| When you need... | Choose | Output Character |
|------------------|--------|------------------|
| **Implementation steps** ("How do I do this?") | **Low** | Tactical, concrete, actionable |
| **Strategic framework** ("What approach should I take?") | **Medium** | Strategic, framework-oriented, systems-thinking |
| **Foundational thinking** ("Why am I doing this?") | **High** | Philosophical, assumption-challenging, research-informed |

---

## Detailed Characteristics

### Low Effort

**Best for:**
- ✅ Concrete, well-defined problems with clear scope
- ✅ Implementation planning (need tactical checklists)
- ✅ Time-sensitive decisions (need quick turnaround)
- ✅ Material/logistical questions (costs, schedules, resources)
- ✅ Personal projects with limited stakes
- ✅ Supplementing existing strategic direction

**Output includes:**
- Specific costs and time estimates
- Material lists and vendors
- Step-by-step implementation guides
- Concrete examples and templates
- Practical workarounds and tips

**Time investment:** ~10-15 minutes
**Question count:** 15-20 questions across 3-5 topics
**Output size:** ~10-15 KB final deliverable

**Example requests:**
- "Help me plan a birthday party for my daughter"
- "Create a moving checklist for relocating to a new city"
- "Design a meal prep system for busy weekdays"
- "Organize a small office reorganization"
- "Plan a weekend camping trip itinerary"

**Sample output:**
> "Hang glow-in-the-dark ceiling stars ($10-15) in dense clusters with 2-3 LED string lights (45 minutes setup time). Use tension rod with silver curtain at entrance ($15, 15 minutes)."

### Medium Effort

**Best for:**
- ✅ Complex decisions requiring strategic thinking
- ✅ Problems where assumptions should be challenged
- ✅ Design decisions with multiple valid approaches
- ✅ Situations requiring framework development
- ✅ Moderate-stakes professional work
- ✅ When diverse perspectives add value

**Output includes:**
- Strategic frameworks and design principles
- Trade-off analysis between approaches
- Systems-level thinking and relationships
- Multiple valid approaches with pros/cons
- Decision criteria and evaluation frameworks

**Time investment:** ~20-30 minutes
**Question count:** 25-35 questions across 4-7 topics
**Personas:** 3 (cognitive diversity: visionary, analytical, pragmatic)
**Output size:** ~20-25 KB final deliverable

**Example requests:**
- "Design a product feature for user authentication"
- "Develop a content strategy for our blog"
- "Create an organizational process for code reviews"
- "Plan a community engagement program"
- "Design a career development framework"
- "Develop a home renovation strategy"

**Sample output:**
> "Three foundational principles emerged: (1) Interaction over observation—design 'play with' experiences, not 'look at' decorations; (2) Child-scale immersion—floor-level activities sized for 5-year-old bodies; (3) Narrative as emotional glue—transform random activities into cohesive missions."

### High Effort

**Best for:**
- ✅ Foundational decisions with long-term implications
- ✅ Problems requiring assumption examination
- ✅ High-stakes professional or personal decisions
- ✅ Research and exploration (discovering unknowns)
- ✅ When philosophical depth adds value
- ✅ Situations where convergence confidence matters

**Output includes:**
- Foundational questions and theoretical frameworks
- Research-informed recommendations
- Explicit convergence documentation ("5/5 personas agreed...")
- Assumption-challenging perspectives
- Long-term implications and systemic effects
- Academic/theoretical grounding

**Time investment:** ~45-60 minutes
**Question count:** 40-60 questions across 6-9 topics
**Personas:** 5 (worldview diversity: enables convergence documentation)
**Output size:** ~25-35 KB final deliverable

**Example requests:**
- "Develop a business strategy for entering a new market"
- "Design a research project on user behavior"
- "Create a policy framework for remote work"
- "Plan a major career transition"
- "Develop an organizational transformation strategy"
- "Design an educational curriculum from first principles"

**Sample output:**
> "Universal agreement (5/5 personas): Birthday parties serve as critical social scaffolding events where children practice complex cognitive and emotional skills. The party should be designed as a developmental laboratory, not merely entertainment. This foundational reframing shifts every design decision toward supporting children's emerging capacity for social navigation."

## Decision Tree

```
START: What guidance do you need?

Do you already know WHAT you want to do?
├─ YES: Do you need help with HOW to implement it?
│  └─ YES → LOW EFFORT
│     "I know what I want; I need implementation steps"
│
└─ NO: Do you need to understand your OPTIONS before deciding?
   ├─ YES: Is this a high-stakes decision with long-term implications?
   │  ├─ YES: Do you need to challenge fundamental assumptions?
   │  │  └─ YES → HIGH EFFORT
   │  │     "I need to understand WHY before I can determine WHAT"
   │  │
   │  └─ NO → MEDIUM EFFORT
   │     "I need to understand the strategic landscape"
   │
   └─ If still uncertain → MEDIUM EFFORT (safe default)
```

## Key Insights from Research

### 1. Effort Level Creates Qualitative, Not Quantitative Differences

**Increasing effort doesn't just add more ideas—it changes the TYPE of thinking:**

- **Low effort** answers: "How can I transform a room into space theme?"
  - Response: "$15 silver curtain, tension rod, 30 minutes setup"

- **Medium effort** answers: "What assumptions are we making about space themes?"
  - Response: "Adults see space as cold/scientific; children see it as magical realm of possibility"

- **High effort** answers: "Why do birthday parties exist from developmental psychology perspective?"
  - Response: "Parties serve as social scaffolding for identity formation and reciprocity norms"

### 2. Higher Effort Enables More Aggressive Compression

- **Low:** 40% retention (lighter input needs preservation)
- **Medium:** 47% retention (intelligent topic-aware compression)
- **High:** 24% retention (richer input enables distillation)

**Why?** More personas saying similar things → synthesis can compress to one high-confidence principle.

### 3. Five Personas Enable Convergence Documentation

**High effort innovation:** Synthesis explicitly documents agreement levels.

- "All 5 personas converged on..." = **high confidence**
- "3/5 personas argued X, 2/5 suggested Y" = **explore both**
- "Only Devil's Advocate raised X" = **consider overlooked risk**

This confidence signaling is unique to high effort (5 personas).

### 4. Evidence Type Shifts by Effort Level

| Effort | Evidence Type | Example |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| Low | Concrete | "$15, 30 minutes, tension rod, silver curtain" |
| Medium | Conceptual | "Interaction over observation, child-scale immersion" |
| High | Theoretical | "Developmental psychology, social scaffolding, identity formation" |

## Common Misconceptions

### ❌ "Higher effort is always better"

**Reality:** Higher effort may overcomplicate simple decisions. Use low effort when you need tactical guidance.

**Example:** Planning a simple birthday party where you already know the theme and just need implementation ideas → Low effort is optimal. High effort would generate philosophical questions about the meaning of celebration that aren't helpful.

### ❌ "Low effort produces lower quality"

**Reality:** All effort levels produce professional-quality output. They serve different purposes.

**Example:** Low effort tactical guidance can be MORE valuable than high effort philosophical frameworks when you need to execute quickly.

### ❌ "High effort takes too long"

**Reality:** 45-60 minutes for foundational thinking on a high-stakes decision is efficient, not slow.

**Example:** Spending an hour on high effort brainstorming for a major career change is much faster than making a poor decision and course-correcting later.

### ❌ "I should choose based on how much time I have"

**Reality:** Choose based on what TYPE of thinking you need, then allocate appropriate time.

**Example:** If you need strategic framework development, 10 minutes of low effort won't help. Either allocate 20-30 minutes for medium effort, or postpone until you have appropriate time.

## Hybrid Approaches (Future)

**Potential combinations not yet implemented:**

- **Strategic + Tactical:** Medium effort questions → Low effort responses (frameworks + implementation)
- **Foundational + Practical:** High effort questions → Medium effort responses (philosophy + strategy)
- **Tiered synthesis:** High effort exploration → Medium effort synthesis → Low effort action items

If you need a hybrid approach, consider running two separate sessions:
1. First session (high or medium) to establish strategy
2. Second session (low) to develop implementation plan

- "What approach should I...?" → **Medium**
- "Why should I...?" or "What if I'm wrong about...?" → **High**

**"What would make this session successful?"**

- "A checklist I can follow" → **Low**
- "A framework to guide my decisions" → **Medium**
- "Deep understanding of the problem space" → **High**

**"What's the cost of being wrong?"**

- Low stakes, easy to adjust → **Low**
- Moderate stakes, some adjustment needed → **Medium**

## When to Override Suggestions

The orchestrator will suggest an effort level based on your request, but you should override if:

- **You want tactical implementation** for a normally strategic topic → Choose Low
- **You want deep exploration** of a normally simple topic → Choose High
- **You have limited time** but need strategic thinking → Choose Medium (compromise)
- **You're prototyping** the brainstorming process → Choose Low first, then run Medium/High if valuable

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### "Can I upgrade from low to medium later?"

Not directly. Each session is independent. However, you can:
1. Review low effort output
2. Start a new medium effort session building on those insights
3. Reference the low effort session in your new REQUEST.md

### "Can I run the same topic at multiple effort levels?"

Yes! This is actually valuable for comparison:
- Run low effort for tactical baseline
- Run medium effort for strategic framework
- Run high effort for foundational questioning

You'll get complementary perspectives.

### "What if I choose wrong?"

No session is wasted. Even if you chose "wrong" effort level:
- Low effort tactical guidance may reveal strategic questions → Run medium next
- High effort philosophical exploration may clarify you need tactics → Run low next
- Medium effort may reveal you need deeper thinking → Run high next

### "Does effort level affect persona quality?"

No. All effort levels use the same high-quality personas and prompts. The difference is:
- **Low:** 1 generic voice (no personas)
- **Medium:** 3 personas (cognitive diversity)
- **High:** 5 personas (worldview diversity + convergence)

More personas = more perspectives, not better quality per perspective.
