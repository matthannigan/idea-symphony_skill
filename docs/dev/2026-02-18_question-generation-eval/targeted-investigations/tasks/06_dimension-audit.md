# Phase 2B Question Generation — Targeted Investigation

**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Parent:** `docs/dev/2026-02-18_question-generation-research.md` (Step C)
**Inputs:**
- Step A quantitative baselines (`docs/dev/2026-02-19_question-generation-research-analysis-stepA.md`)
- Step B external research synthesis (`docs/dev/2026-02-18_question-generation-eval/question-generation-ext-research_synthesis.md`)

## Background

### Phase 2B Design

Phase 2B uses **fixed persona assignments** for question generation with no topic-aware selection:

| Effort | Personas |
|--------|----------|
| Medium (3) | The Questioner, The Analyst, The Audience Advocate |
| High (5) | + The Devil's Advocate, The First Principles Thinker |

### Analytical Bias Hypothesis

All five current Phase 2B personas are classified as Analytical. Zero Generative personas. Zero Connective personas. Two of the five (Questioner, Analyst) are retired from Phase 3.

**Hypothesis:** The all-analytical composition systematically biases question generation toward analytical framing — risks, trade-offs, feasibility, stakeholder mapping — while underrepresenting creative, provocative, emotional, and systems-oriented question territory.

### External Research Findings (Step B)

All three independent analyses (Gemini, Manus, Perplexity) agree:
- The current Phase 2B set fully covers convergent, evaluative, and Socratic analytical question types
- It provides **no dedicated divergent question sources** and only thin generative framing via Audience Advocate
- Strong generative question generators exist in the roster (Provocateur, Visionary, Analogist, Constraint Flipper) but aren't used in Phase 2B
- Professional facilitation research emphasizes divergent-convergent sequencing, Appreciative Inquiry, and emotional/narrative questions as critical for high-quality question portfolios

### Cross-Phase Convergence Concept

Phase 2B questions go through synthesis into topic clusters, then to the full Phase 3 roster. A persona that generates "selfless" questions — opening territory for other personas to excel in — is more valuable for Phase 2B than one that generates great questions only it can answer.

### Research Questions

1. **RQ1 Distinctiveness:** Do different personas generate meaningfully different questions?
2. **RQ2 Analytical bias:** Does the current all-analytical set produce narrower territory?
3. **RQ3 Topic-aware selection:** Is there sufficient variation across topics to justify a selection algorithm?
4. **RQ4 Cross-phase convergence:** Do personas ask questions they can answer? Which generate "selfless" questions?
5. **RQ5 Cluster divergence:** Do personas produce different topic cluster structures?
6. **RQ6 Topic sensitivity:** Do some personas generate better questions for certain topics?
7. **RQ7 Retired persona fitness:** Do Questioner/Analyst excel at question generation?

## Quantitative Signals Summary (Step A)

**Volume tiers (avg KB across 3 topics):**
- High (>8 KB): Lawyer 11.0, Systems Thinker 10.3, Momentum Builder 8.8, Audience Advocate 8.6, Provocateur 8.5, Connector 8.2
- Medium (6-8 KB): Politician 7.7, Futurist 7.4, Storyteller 7.3, Analogist 7.3, Devil's Advocate 7.3, Empath 7.3, Visionary 7.1, Analyst 7.0, Accountant 6.8, FPT 6.5, Questioner 6.3
- Low (<6 KB): Pragmatist 5.9, Simplifier 5.8, Technical Expert 5.6, Constraint Flipper 5.6, Synthesizer 5.5

**Consistency (CV%):**
- Highly consistent (CV < 10%): Empath 1.4%, Systems Thinker 2.2%, Questioner 2.7%, Synthesizer 3.5%, Constraint Flipper 3.7%, Futurist 4.4%, Simplifier 7.8%, Pragmatist 9.0%, Analyst 9.7%, Technical Expert 9.7%
- Moderate (10-25%): Most others
- High variance: Politician 30.3%

**Cluster structure:**
- 82% of files have exactly 5 clusters (strong convergence on count)
- Variation is in cluster *naming and framing*, not count
- Analytical personas converge on similar cluster themes (risk, stakeholder, feasibility)
- Distinctive cluster structures from: Analogist, Provocateur, Storyteller, Constraint Flipper, Visionary

**Current Phase 2B set:**
- Volume: Questioner 6.3, Analyst 7.0, AA 8.6, DA 7.3, FPT 6.5 — dead-center average
- Consistency: Mixed (Questioner 2.7% to DA 21.6%)
- Both retired personas (Questioner, Analyst) are mid-pack — unremarkable

## Investigation Task

### I06: Current Phase 2B Set — Dimension Coverage Audit

**Key question:** What is the actual dimension distribution of questions generated by the current Phase 2B set? The analytical bias hypothesis predicts heavy weighting toward Analytical and Strategic dimensions with underrepresentation of Creative, Provocative, Human-centered, and Systems dimensions. This investigation provides the quantitative foundation for confirming or refuting that hypothesis.

**Research questions addressed:** RQ2 (analytical bias), RQ6 (topic sensitivity)

**Quantitative context:**
- 5 personas × 3 topics = 15 files
- Total ~109 KB
- Step A found these personas create clusters around "risk assessment, resource allocation, stakeholder analysis, and success criteria" — all analytical themes
- Audience Advocate is the potential exception — classified as Analytical (human-centered triad) but may produce more Human-centered dimension questions

**Dimension taxonomy:**

Classify each question into one or more of these dimensions:
- **Strategic** — Long-term direction, vision, goals, positioning
- **Tactical** — Implementation, logistics, operations, resources
- **Creative** — Novel approaches, design, aesthetics, experience
- **Analytical** — Risks, trade-offs, evaluation, frameworks, metrics
- **Human-centered** — User needs, emotions, accessibility, stakeholder perspectives
- **Systems** — Interdependencies, feedback loops, second-order effects, scaling
- **Provocative/Lateral** — Assumption-challenging, absurdist, constraint-inverting, paradigm-breaking

**Analysis method:**
1. Read each question file and classify every distinct question by dimension(s)
2. Produce per-persona dimension counts (a question can be multi-dimensional)
3. Produce per-topic dimension counts (aggregate across personas)
4. Produce combined set totals
5. Identify which dimensions are overrepresented (>30% of total) and underrepresented (<5%)
6. Note any questions that fall outside the analytical/strategic territory — these represent the current set's "reach" into other dimensions

**Expected output:**
- Dimension distribution table: persona × dimension × topic (counts and percentages)
- Combined set distribution (all 5 personas aggregated)
- Per-topic variation: does the dimension mix shift across space-party, tool-library, habit-tracker?
- Gap assessment: which dimensions are systematically absent or underrepresented?
- Audience Advocate differentiation: does AA meaningfully shift the dimension balance?

**Priority:** High — this is the primary evidence for or against the analytical bias hypothesis. The dimension distribution directly informs Phase 2B roster recommendations.
