# Research on Question Generation Methodologies in Professional Brainstorming and Facilitated Dialogue

## Research Domain 1A: Question Taxonomies

This document investigates established taxonomies for classifying questions in facilitated brainstorming and dialogue, focusing on several key areas: Socratic questioning categories, divergent vs. convergent question design, generative vs. evaluative question framing, and question level/depth.

## Taxonomy of Question Types

| Category | Sub-Category | Definition | Example | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Socratic Questioning** | Questions for Clarification | Ensure understanding and elicit more information. | "Can you explain what you mean by that?" | [1] |
| | Questions that Probe Assumptions | Challenge underlying beliefs and assumptions. | "What are you taking for granted?" | [1] |
| | Questions that Probe Reasons & Evidence | Encourage justification and evidence for claims. | "What evidence supports your claim?" | [1] |
| | Questions about Viewpoints & Perspectives | Encourage consideration of alternative viewpoints. | "What is another way to look at it?" | [1] |
| | Questions that Probe Implications & Consequences | Focus on potential outcomes and effects. | "What are the consequences of that assumption?" | [1] |
| | Questions about the Question (Meta-questions) | Encourage reflection on the questioning process itself. | "What was the point of this question?" | [1] |
| **Question Design** | Divergent | Open-ended questions that encourage exploration and generation of multiple ideas. | "What are all the possible ways we could address this issue?" | [2] |
| | Convergent | Questions designed to narrow down possibilities and arrive at a specific answer. | "What is the primary cause of this problem?" | [2] |
| **Question Framing** | Generative | Open-ended questions to explore, discover, and understand a problem space. | "What challenges do you face in your role?" | [3] |
| | Evaluative | Questions used to assess how well a proposed solution meets user needs. | "Does this feature help you complete your task more efficiently?" | [3] |
| **Question Level/Depth** | Surface-Level | Inquiries that gather basic information, facts, and definitions. | "What are the basic facts of the situation?" | [4] |
| | Deep-Level | Questions that delve beneath the surface to explore underlying causes, motivations, and implications. | "Why do you think that happened?" | [4] |

## Detailed Analysis of Question Taxonomies

### 1. Socratic Questioning Categories

Socratic questioning is a disciplined and thoughtful dialogue method used to explore complex ideas, uncover assumptions, and stimulate critical thinking. It is widely applied in teaching, counseling, and facilitated discussions to encourage deeper understanding and reflection [1]. R.W. Paul's six types of Socratic questions provide a comprehensive framework for this methodology, as detailed in the taxonomy table above.

### 2. Divergent vs. Convergent Question Design

Convergent and divergent thinking represent two fundamental modes of problem-solving, and the design of questions can either expand or narrow the solution space. Convergent questions are effective for tasks requiring precision and analysis, while divergent questions are crucial for stimulating creativity and exploring new possibilities. A balanced approach, moving between divergent and convergent questioning, is essential for effective creative problem-solving [2].

### 3. Generative vs. Evaluative Question Framing

The framing of a question significantly influences the type and scope of responses. Generative framing broadens the response space, encouraging diverse ideas and insights, while evaluative framing narrows the focus to specific feedback on a proposed solution. The choice between generative and evaluative questions depends on the research phase, with generative questions dominating the discovery phase and evaluative questions becoming more prominent in the design and development phases [3].

### 4. Question Level/Depth (Surface vs. Deep)

Questions can be categorized by their level of depth, ranging from surface-level inquiries to deep-level questions. Surface-level questions are essential for establishing a common understanding, while deep-level questions challenge assumptions and provoke introspection. Effective facilitators balance these question types to manage the conversation's flow and depth, building rapport, ensuring clarity, and promoting engagement to achieve deeper insights [4].
