"Research Domain 1A: Question Taxonomies — Research established taxonomies for classifying questions in facilitated brainstorming and dialogue. Cover: (1) Socratic questioning categories (clarification, probing assumptions, probing reasons/evidence, questioning viewpoints, probing implications, meta-questions), (2) Divergent vs. convergent question design and what makes each effective, (3) Generative vs. evaluative question framing and how framing shapes response space, (4) Question level/depth (surface vs. deep) and how facilitators balance these. Deliverable: A taxonomy table of question types with definitions and examples for each category.",/home/ubuntu/research_findings/0_aDY3cmy6IKx5towg55JdJr_1771478671534_na1fn_L2hvbWUvdWJ1bnR1L3Jlc2VhcmNoX2ZpbmRpbmdz.md,"Socratic Method, Divergent vs. Convergent Thinking, Generative vs. Evaluative Question Framing, Question Level/Depth","This research domain is well-established with multiple academic frameworks and practitioner guidance covering Socratic questioning, divergent/convergent thinking, generative/evaluative framing, and question depth.",4,
"Research Domain 1B: Facilitation Frameworks Applied to Question Design — Research how established facilitation and creative thinking frameworks approach question generation. Cover: (1) Appreciative Inquiry 4-D Cycle and positive/affirmative framing, (2) Creative Problem Solving (CPS) distinction between problem-finding and solution-finding questions, (3) Design Thinking 'How Might We' question formulation and scoping, (4) Lateral Thinking question techniques (random entry, provocation, movement, challenge), (5) Six Thinking Hats applied to questions (how Red Hat questions differ from Green Hat questions). Deliverable: Per-framework summary of question design principles with examples of questions each framework would produce for a generic brainstorming topic.",/home/ubuntu/research_findings/1_twllKsNf70Sb4UTLbItEbm_1771479352363_na1fn_L2hvbWUvdWJ1bnR1L3F1ZXN0aW9uX2dlbmVyYXRpb25fbWV0aG9kb2xvZ2llcw.md,"Appreciative Inquiry, Creative Problem Solving, Design Thinking, Lateral Thinking, Six Thinking Hats","The research domain is well-established in practitioner guidance, with several widely adopted frameworks for question generation. Academic literature provides foundational theories and some empirical studies, particularly in areas like Creative Problem Solving and Design Thinking.",5,
Research Domain 1C: Cognitive Diversity in Question Generation — Research the relationship between cognitive diversity among question-askers and quality of downstream ideation. Cover: (1) Does diverse cognitive styles among question-generators produce better ideation outcomes than homogeneous ones? (2) What is the relationship between question diversity and solution diversity? (3) Are there documented cases where analytical-only question framing constrained creative output? (4) What cognitive modes are most important to represent in a question-generation team? Deliverable: Summary of research findings on cognitive diversity's impact on question quality and downstream ideation.,/home/ubuntu/research_findings/2_tOuLV32wqVHlpf3RzwPDVd_1771478699130_na1fn_L2hvbWUvdWJ1bnR1L3Jlc2VhcmNoX2RvY3VtZW50.md,"Kirton's Adaption-Innovation (A-I) theory, Bloom's Taxonomy, ReQUESTA Framework","This research domain is well-established with multiple academic frameworks such as Bloom's Taxonomy and the ReQUESTA framework, complemented by practitioner guidance on cognitive diversity's impact on team performance. While the empirical evidence on cognitive diversity's direct impact is mixed, the literature provides robust conceptual models for understanding and leveraging diverse thinking styles in question generation.",5,
"Research Domain 1D: Question Quality Dimensions — Research what makes a brainstorming question 'good'. Cover: (1) Open-ended vs. closed question effectiveness in ideation contexts, (2) The role of constraint in question design (too broad = unfocused, too narrow = limiting), (3) How question specificity affects response diversity, (4) Whether questions with embedded assumptions produce more or less creative responses, (5) The difference between questions that invite analysis vs. questions that invite imagination. Deliverable: A rubric or set of quality dimensions for evaluating brainstorming questions.",/home/ubuntu/research_findings/3_LmTrY5CGemIB96S3PaHw5d_1771478923888_na1fn_L2hvbWUvdWJ1bnR1L3Jlc2VhcmNoX2RvY3VtZW50.md,"How Might We (HMW) Framework, Osborn's Brainstorming Technique, Divergent Questions","This research domain is well-established with academic frameworks like Osborn's Brainstorming Technique and practitioner guidance such as the ""How Might We"" framework, complemented by research on divergent thinking.",3,
"Research Domain 1E: Bias in Question Generation — Research how question framing introduces systematic bias into brainstorming. Cover: (1) Anchoring effects: Do early questions constrain later thinking? (2) Framing bias: Does analytical framing suppress creative responses? Does creative framing suppress analytical rigor? (3) Facilitation techniques for counteracting question bias, (4) The question-response loop: Does the type of questions asked predetermine the type of answers generated? Deliverable: Summary of bias mechanisms and evidence-based countermeasures from facilitation practice.",/home/ubuntu/research_findings/4_yi1V53kmUVTNfwJ7ioiK5y_1771478880299_na1fn_L2hvbWUvdWJ1bnR1L3Jlc2VhcmNoX2ZpbmRpbmdz.md,"Anchoring Effect, Framing Effect, Prospect Theory, Question-Response Loop, Facilitation Techniques","The research domain of bias in question generation is moderately covered, with well-established academic frameworks for anchoring and framing effects, and practical guidance on facilitation techniques. The question-response loop is discussed, particularly in the context of AI-driven systems.",3,
