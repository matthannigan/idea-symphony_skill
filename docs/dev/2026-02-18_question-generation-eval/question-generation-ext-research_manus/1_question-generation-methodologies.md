# Research on Question Generation Methodologies in Professional Brainstorming and Facilitated Dialogue

This document synthesizes research on question generation methodologies within established facilitation and creative thinking frameworks, focusing on their application in professional brainstorming and facilitated dialogue. The critical context for this research is evaluating a brainstorming system where personas operate as isolated subagents with separate context windows, producing written output without real-time group discussion.

## 1. Appreciative Inquiry (AI) 4-D Cycle and Positive/Affirmative Framing

### Principles of Question Design

Appreciative Inquiry (AI) is a strengths-based approach that focuses on identifying and amplifying what works well within a system, rather than dwelling on problems. The 4-D Cycle (Discover, Dream, Design, Destiny, or Inquire, Imagine, Innovate, Implement) guides this process. Question generation in AI is characterized by **positive and affirmative framing**, aiming to elicit stories of success, strengths, values, and aspirations. The core assumption is that questions and dialogue about strengths are inherently transformational [1].

AI questions are designed to be stated in the affirmative, focusing on what is desired or what has worked well. They forge personal connections by encouraging interviewees to share personal experiences and stories, assuming a positive outlook. These questions give a broad definition to the topic, allowing for rich storytelling rather than narrow, factual answers. They invite narratives over abstract opinions, valuing  what is already working and sparking appreciative imagination by focusing on past or present successes. A key element is conveying unconditional, positive regard to create a safe space for sharing. The questions aim to evoke essential values, aspirations, and inspirations, connecting to deeper motivations. They are grounded in real-world context by drawing on people’s life and work experience and are designed to lead towards future possibilities by suggesting action [1].

### Examples of Questions for a Generic Brainstorming Topic (e.g., "Improving Team Collaboration")

The following table provides examples of questions for each phase of the AI 4-D Cycle, applied to the topic of improving team collaboration:

| 4-D Cycle Phase | Example Questions |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Discover (Inquire)** | - "Tell me about a time when our team collaboration was at its absolute best. What made it so successful and satisfying?"<br>- "What unique strengths do you bring to team collaboration, and how have they contributed to our past successes?"<br>- "When have you felt most alive and engaged while collaborating with colleagues? What was happening during that time?"<br>- "What are the core values that underpin our most effective collaborative efforts?" |
| **Dream (Imagine)** | - "Imagine our team collaboration three years from now, operating at its highest potential. What does it look like, sound like, and feel like?"<br>- "If a magic wand could instantly transform our team collaboration into its ideal state, what would be the most significant changes you would see?"<br>- "What bold aspirations do we have for our collaborative future that would truly set us apart?" |
| **Design (Innovate)** | - "What provocative propositions can we create that would ensure our team consistently experiences the peak collaboration moments we've described?"<br>- "How might we design our processes and interactions to amplify our collective strengths and foster even greater synergy?"<br>- "What specific elements of our 'dream' collaboration can we commit to building into our daily work?" |
| **Destiny (Implement)** | - "What immediate actions can each of us take to bring our provocative propositions for enhanced collaboration to life?"<br>- "How will we celebrate our successes and continuously learn as we implement these new collaborative practices?"<br>- "Who else needs to be involved, and what support do we need to sustain this elevated level of team collaboration?" |

## 2. Creative Problem Solving (CPS) Distinction Between Problem-Finding and Solution-Finding Questions

### Principles of Question Design

Creative Problem Solving (CPS) is a structured methodology for solving problems or finding opportunities that goes beyond conventional thinking. It emphasizes balancing **divergent thinking** (generating many ideas) and **convergent thinking** (evaluating and refining ideas). A key aspect of CPS question generation is the deliberate distinction between **problem-finding** and **solution-finding** questions, as well as other stages of the process. Questions in CPS are designed to explore the vision, gather data, and formulate challenges by sharpening awareness and creating open-ended questions that invite solutions. They are open-ended to encourage a wide range of responses and possibilities, and they avoid premature judgment by separating idea generation from evaluation. The questions focus on the desired outcome, addressing root problems rather than symptoms, and are phrased positively, using positive action verbs to encourage creativity [2].

### Examples of Questions for a Generic Brainstorming Topic (e.g., "Improving Team Collaboration")

The following table illustrates question types within the CPS framework for improving team collaboration:

| CPS Stage | Question Type | Example Questions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Explore the Vision** | Objective Finding | - "What is our ideal vision for team collaboration?"<br>- "What challenges are we currently facing in achieving optimal team collaboration?"<br>- "Wouldn't it be great if our team collaboration was...?" |
| **Gather Data** | Fact-Finding | - "What data do we have about our current team collaboration processes and outcomes?"<br>- "What are the specific instances where our team collaboration has been effective or ineffective?"<br>- "Who are the key stakeholders involved in team collaboration, and what are their perspectives?" |
| **Formulate Challenges** | Problem-Finding | - "How might we better understand the root causes of our collaboration challenges?"<br>- "In what ways can we reframe our current collaboration issues as opportunities for improvement?"<br>- "What are all the possible ways we could define the problem of 'suboptimal team collaboration'?" |
| **Ideate** | Solution-Finding | - "What are all the possible solutions to enhance our team collaboration?"<br>- "How might we encourage more open communication within the team?"<br>- "What innovative approaches could we take to foster a stronger sense of shared purpose?"<br>- "What if we completely reimagined our team meetings to be more engaging and productive?" |
| **Develop** | Solution-Finding | - "What criteria will we use to evaluate the potential solutions for improving team collaboration?"<br>- "Which of these solutions are most feasible and impactful for our team?"<br>- "How can we refine our chosen solutions to maximize their effectiveness?" |
| **Implement** | Acceptance-Finding | - "What steps are needed to put our chosen collaboration solutions into practice?"<br>- "Who will be responsible for implementing each aspect of the solution?"<br>- "How will we measure the success of our new collaboration strategies?" |

## 3. Design Thinking 'How Might We' Question Formulation and Scoping

### Principles of Question Design

Design Thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that focuses on understanding user needs and developing creative solutions. The 'How Might We' (HMW) question is a crucial tool in the ideation phase, bridging insights from user research to potential solutions. HMW questions are designed to be based on problems or insights, directly addressing identified user needs or pain points. They avoid suggesting solutions, remaining open-ended to encourage a wide range of ideas. These questions are broad enough for creativity but narrow enough to be actionable, striking a balance between inspiring diverse ideas and maintaining focus. They concentrate on the desired outcome, addressing the root problem and what needs to be achieved, and are phrased positively, using positive language to foster an optimistic and generative mindset [3].

### Examples of Questions for a Generic Brainstorming Topic (e.g., "Improving Team Collaboration")

The following table provides examples of 'How Might We' questions for improving team collaboration, derived from common problems or insights:

| Problem/Insight | 'How Might We' Question Examples |
| :--- | :--- |
| Team members often feel their ideas aren't heard in meetings. | - "How might we create an environment where all team members feel empowered to share their ideas?"<br>- "How might we ensure equitable participation and voice in team discussions?" |
| Lack of clear communication leads to misunderstandings and duplicated effort. | - "How might we improve clarity and reduce ambiguity in team communications?"<br>- "How might we enable seamless information flow that prevents misunderstandings and optimizes effort?" |
| Remote team members feel disconnected from the rest of the team. | - "How might we foster a stronger sense of connection and belonging among remote team members?"<br>- "How might we enhance virtual interactions to build a cohesive and engaged remote team?" |

## 4. Lateral Thinking Question Techniques (Random Entry, Provocation, Movement, Challenge)

### Principles of Question Design

Lateral Thinking, developed by Edward de Bono, is about generating new ideas and solving problems by looking at them from unexpected angles, often by deliberately breaking conventional thought patterns. Its techniques are designed to disrupt linear thinking and encourage novel connections. Key question techniques include Random Entry, which introduces a random word, object, or image to stimulate new associations and perspectives related to the problem. Provocation (PO) involves making a deliberately absurd or impossible statement to challenge assumptions and generate new ideas that might not otherwise emerge, often starting with "PO" (Provocative Operation). Movement uses a provocation as a stepping stone to generate new ideas, rather than evaluating its practicality directly, focusing on moving forward from the unusual. Challenge involves questioning existing assumptions, rules, or ways of doing things, even those that seem obvious or fundamental, to open up new possibilities [4].

### Examples of Questions for a Generic Brainstorming Topic (e.g., "Improving Team Collaboration")

The following table presents examples of Lateral Thinking questions for improving team collaboration:

| Lateral Thinking Technique | Example Questions |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Random Entry** (using the word "cloud") | - "How does a 'cloud' relate to our team collaboration? What ideas does that spark?"<br>- "If our team collaboration were a 'cloud,' what kind of cloud would it be, and what does that tell us about how to improve it?"<br>- "What elements of 'cloud' technology or nature could inspire new ways of collaborating?" |
| **Provocation (PO)** | - "PO: All team meetings must be conducted in silence." (What ideas does this absurd rule provoke about communication or non-verbal cues?)<br>- "PO: Every team member must disagree with the last idea proposed." (What does this provoke about critical thinking or alternative perspectives?) |
| **Movement** (from the "silent meeting" provocation) | - "If meetings were silent, how would we ensure understanding? This makes me think about visual communication tools or pre-reading materials. How can we integrate more of these?"<br>- "What if we used a silent period at the start of every meeting for individual reflection before discussion?" |
| **Challenge** | - "Why do we always start our projects with a detailed plan? What if we started with a minimal viable product instead?"<br>- "Why do we assume that team collaboration must happen synchronously? What if asynchronous collaboration was our primary mode?"<br>- "What if we challenged the notion that all decisions require full team consensus?" |

## 5. Six Thinking Hats Applied to Questions

### Principles of Question Design

Edward de Bono's Six Thinking Hats is a powerful tool for parallel thinking, allowing individuals and teams to explore a topic from different perspectives without conflict. Each hat represents a different mode of thinking, and by consciously switching hats, a comprehensive view can be achieved. When applied to question generation, each hat guides the type of questions asked:

*   **White Hat (Facts & Information):** Focuses on objective facts, figures, and information. Questions seek data, evidence, and verifiable truths.
*   **Red Hat (Feelings & Intuition):** Focuses on emotions, feelings, and intuition without justification. Questions explore gut reactions, likes, dislikes, and emotional responses.
*   **Black Hat (Caution & Critical Judgment):** Focuses on risks, problems, weaknesses, and potential negative outcomes. Questions identify flaws, dangers, and reasons why something might not work.
*   **Yellow Hat (Optimism & Benefits):** Focuses on positive aspects, benefits, value, and opportunities. Questions explore advantages, feasibility, and potential gains.
*   **Green Hat (Creativity & New Ideas):** Focuses on new ideas, alternatives, possibilities, and creative solutions. Questions encourage divergent thinking, brainstorming, and innovation.
*   **Blue Hat (Process Control & Organization):** Focuses on managing the thinking process itself. Questions guide the discussion, set agendas, and summarize conclusions [5].

### How Red Hat Questions Differ from Green Hat Questions

**Red Hat questions** are subjective and emotional, exploring feelings, instincts, and gut reactions without requiring logic or justification. They are about expressing emotions related to the topic. In contrast, **Green Hat questions** are creative and generative, aiming to produce new ideas, alternatives, and possibilities. They are about exploring new directions and innovative solutions.

### Examples of Questions for a Generic Brainstorming Topic (e.g., "Improving Team Collaboration")

The following table provides examples of questions for each of the Six Thinking Hats, applied to the topic of improving team collaboration:

| Thinking Hat | Focus | Example Questions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **White Hat** | Facts & Information | - "What are the current statistics on our team's project completion rates and deadlines?"<br>- "What communication tools are currently in use by the team, and how frequently are they utilized?"<br>- "What are the documented procedures for conflict resolution within the team?" |
| **Red Hat** | Feelings & Intuition | - "How do you *feel* about the current level of team collaboration?"<br>- "What is your gut reaction to the idea of implementing a new collaboration platform?"<br>- "What concerns or excitements do you *sense* regarding potential changes to our team dynamics?" |
| **Black Hat** | Caution & Critical Judgment | - "What are the potential risks or downsides of changing our current collaboration methods?"<br>- "Where could a new collaboration initiative fail, and what obstacles might we encounter?"<br>- "What are the weaknesses in our current team structure that could hinder improved collaboration?" |
| **Yellow Hat** | Optimism & Benefits | - "What are the potential benefits of fostering stronger team collaboration?"<br>- "How could improved collaboration positively impact our project outcomes and team morale?"<br>- "What opportunities might arise if our team collaboration reached an exemplary level?" |
| **Green Hat** | Creativity & New Ideas | - "What entirely new ways could we imagine for our team to collaborate that we haven't considered before?"<br>- "If there were no constraints, how would we reinvent team collaboration from scratch?"<br>- "What alternative approaches to team communication could spark breakthrough ideas?" |
| **Blue Hat** | Process Control & Organization | - "What is our objective for this brainstorming session on team collaboration?"<br>- "How should we structure our discussion to ensure we cover all perspectives on collaboration?"<br>- "What conclusions have we reached so far regarding improving team collaboration?" |

## Conclusion

This research highlights that effective question generation is a cornerstone of successful brainstorming and facilitated dialogue across various frameworks. Each methodology offers unique principles and techniques for crafting questions that drive specific outcomes, from uncovering strengths and opportunities to challenging assumptions and fostering creativity. The choice of questioning approach significantly influences the depth and breadth of insights generated, making it a critical consideration for any system designed to facilitate collaborative thinking.
