# Research on Cognitive Diversity in Question Generation and its Impact on Ideation

## 1. Introduction

This research investigates the critical role of **cognitive diversity** in the process of **question generation** and its subsequent influence on **ideation outcomes**, particularly within professional brainstorming and facilitated dialogue contexts. The study aims to explore whether diverse cognitive styles among question-generators lead to superior ideation, the relationship between question diversity and solution diversity, instances where analytical-only question framing has constrained creative output, and the cognitive modes essential for effective question-generation teams. This inquiry is particularly relevant for evaluating brainstorming systems that utilize isolated subagents, where the quality and diversity of generated questions are paramount for fostering innovative solutions.

## 2. Defining Cognitive Diversity

**Cognitive diversity** encompasses the varied ways individuals perceive, process, and apply information, influencing their problem-solving approaches, decision-making patterns, and overall thinking styles [1] [2]. It extends beyond demographic differences to include variations in expertise, experiences, information interpretation, preferences, and fundamental ways of thinking within a team [2]. These diverse cognitive styles can arise from a multitude of sources, such as educational background, professional history, personality types, personal values, life experiences, and even demographic characteristics, which can often serve as a proxy for cognitive differences [2].

Key cognitive styles relevant to ideation and question generation include, but are not limited to, distinctions between optimistic versus pessimistic outlooks, risk-averse versus risk-tolerant dispositions, preferences for quantitative versus qualitative information, extroverted versus introverted communication styles, detail-oriented versus high-level strategic thinking, contrarian versus consensus-oriented approaches, and long-term versus short-term perspectives [2]. Recognizing and leveraging these varied cognitive dimensions is fundamental to understanding their impact on the quality and breadth of generated questions and subsequent ideation.

## 3. Impact of Cognitive Diversity on Question Generation and Ideation

Cognitive diversity profoundly influences the effectiveness of question generation and the richness of ideation outcomes through several interconnected channels, including the generation and sharing of ideas, coordination among team members, and team affinity [2].

### 3.1. Does diverse cognitive styles among question-generators produce better ideation outcomes than homogeneous ones?

Research consistently suggests that teams exhibiting diverse cognitive styles among question-generators tend to produce **better ideation outcomes** compared to homogeneous groups [1] [2]. This superiority stems from the broader spectrum of knowledge, viewpoints, and problem-solving approaches that diverse teams bring to the table. For instance, a cognitively diverse team is better equipped to identify and overcome inherent biases, such as confirmation or familiarity bias, as the presence of varied perspectives can lead to the cancellation of individual biases, resulting in more objective and comprehensive idea generation [2]. The "Wisdom of Crowds" phenomenon exemplifies this, where the collective intelligence of a diverse group often surpasses that of individual experts, leading to highly accurate outcomes even when individual contributions may be flawed [2].

Furthermore, diverse cognitive styles enhance problem-solving by allowing for a more thorough and well-rounded exploration of challenges. Analytical thinkers might meticulously examine data and patterns, while creative thinkers could propose novel solutions previously unconsidered. The synergy between these different thinking styles enables the generation of ideas that are both innovative and practical [1]. In the context of a brainstorming system with isolated subagents, the inherent diversity of these subagents, each with its unique processing and generation capabilities, is expected to yield a wider array of questions and, consequently, more varied and creative ideation outcomes, even in the absence of real-time group discussion [2].

### 3.2. What is the relationship between question diversity and solution diversity?

A direct and significant relationship exists between **question diversity** and **solution diversity**. Diverse questions, particularly those that challenge assumptions and explore problems from multiple angles, are instrumental in stimulating a broader range of cognitive processes, which in turn leads to a wider array of potential solutions [3]. The way a problem or question is framed can either expand or constrain the creative output, depending on the cognitive style of the individual or subagent addressing it [3].

For example, studies on design ideation indicate that innovative cognitive styles and problem framings correlate with higher perceptions of idea diversity and creativity. Conversely, adaptive (more analytical) framings can lead to lower perceptions of creativity and increased difficulty in generating ideas [3]. This implies that a rich and varied set of questions, encompassing different cognitive demands, will naturally encourage a broader spectrum of responses and solutions. If a brainstorming system can generate questions that span various cognitive levels—from factual recall to complex inference and synthesis—it will inherently promote a more diverse and innovative set of solutions from the participating subagents [4].

### 3.3. Are there documented cases where analytical-only question framing constrained creative output?

While explicit, documented cases of "analytical-only question framing" directly constraining creative output are often implicitly rather than explicitly stated in literature, the underlying principles are well-supported [3]. The research on problem framing and cognitive styles provides strong evidence that an over-reliance on adaptive or analytical framing can indeed limit creative output, especially for individuals with innovative cognitive styles [3]. When innovators are compelled to operate within a purely adaptive framework, their perceived creativity tends to decrease, suggesting that rigid, analytical-only approaches to question framing can restrict the breadth and novelty of generated ideas [3].

For instance, in the context of automated question generation, large language models (LLMs) often excel at producing lower-level recall or analytical questions without specific control mechanisms. However, their performance degrades significantly when tasked with generating questions that require higher-order cognitive skills like inference or synthesis [4]. This demonstrates that if question generation is confined to an analytical-only approach, it will inherently limit the cognitive demands placed on respondents, thereby curtailing the potential for creative and inferential ideation. The intentional design of frameworks like ReQUESTA to generate questions across various cognitive levels is a direct response to this recognized limitation of undifferentiated, often analytical, question generation [4].

### 3.4. What cognitive modes are most important to represent in a question-generation team?

To foster comprehensive and innovative ideation, a question-generation team, whether human or agent-based, should represent a diverse array of cognitive modes. Based on the research, the most important cognitive modes to represent include:

*   **Adaptive Thinking:** Characterized by a preference for structured, incremental approaches to problem-solving and a focus on refining existing solutions. This mode is crucial for ensuring questions are well-defined, practical, and grounded in existing knowledge [3].
*   **Innovative Thinking:** Defined by a preference for broad, unstructured approaches, challenging assumptions, and generating novel solutions. This mode is essential for producing questions that push boundaries, encourage divergent thinking, and open new avenues for exploration [3].
*   **Recall/Knowledge-based:** The ability to generate questions that assess explicit factual information and basic concepts. These questions form the foundation for understanding and are critical for ensuring a shared baseline of knowledge [4].
*   **Inferential:** The capacity to formulate questions that require connecting disparate pieces of information, drawing logical conclusions, and understanding implied meanings. These questions move beyond surface-level comprehension and encourage deeper analytical thought [4].
*   **Synthetical/Main Idea:** The skill to create questions that demand an understanding of overarching themes, central arguments, or the integration of multiple concepts into a coherent whole. These questions are vital for fostering higher-order thinking and holistic understanding [4].

By integrating these cognitive modes, a question-generation team can produce a balanced set of inquiries that not only explore the known but also venture into the unknown, leading to richer and more diverse ideation outcomes. The interplay between these styles, and the ability to frame problems (or questions) in ways that resonate with different cognitive preferences, is key to maximizing both idea diversity and creativity [3].

## 4. Key Frameworks and Taxonomies

Several frameworks and taxonomies are instrumental in understanding and guiding cognitively diverse question generation.

### 4.1. General Cognitive Diversity Frameworks

While not exclusively for question generation, general cognitive diversity frameworks provide the foundational understanding of different thinking styles. Kirton's Adaption-Innovation (A-I) theory, for example, categorizes individuals as either Adaptors or Innovators, highlighting their preferred approaches to change and problem-solving [3]. Other frameworks may categorize individuals based on their preferences for quantitative vs. qualitative information, risk tolerance, or communication styles [2]. These frameworks help in identifying and understanding the inherent cognitive differences within a team.

### 4.2. Question Generation Frameworks (e.g., Bloom's Taxonomy, ReQUESTA)

#### Bloom's Taxonomy

**Bloom's Taxonomy** is a widely recognized hierarchical framework that classifies learning objectives into six levels of cognitive complexity, providing a robust tool for crafting questions that target specific intellectual skills [5]. By aligning question generation with these levels, educators and facilitators can ensure a cognitively diverse set of inquiries that stimulate various thought processes. The levels are:

1.  **Knowledge (Remembering):** Focuses on recalling facts and basic concepts. 
    *   *Example Question:* "What are the primary components of cognitive diversity?" [5]
2.  **Comprehension (Understanding):** Involves interpreting and explaining ideas or concepts. 
    *   *Example Question:* "Explain how cognitive diversity differs from demographic diversity." [5]
3.  **Application (Applying):** Requires using knowledge in new situations. 
    *   *Example Question:* "How can a team apply principles of cognitive diversity to improve a brainstorming session?" [5]
4.  **Analysis (Analyzing):** Involves breaking down information into parts and identifying relationships. 
    *   *Example Question:* "Analyze the potential causes for mixed empirical evidence regarding cognitive diversity's impact." [5]
5.  **Synthesis (Creating):** Focuses on combining elements to form a new whole or proposing alternative solutions. 
    *   *Example Question:* "Propose a novel approach to question generation that integrates both adaptive and innovative cognitive styles." [5]
6.  **Evaluation (Evaluating):** Involves making judgments based on criteria and standards. 
    *   *Example Question:* "Evaluate the effectiveness of psychological safety in fostering diverse question generation." [5]

By systematically generating questions across these levels, a team can ensure that ideation is not confined to superficial recall but extends to deeper understanding, critical analysis, creative problem-solving, and informed judgment.

#### ReQUESTA Framework

The **ReQUESTA (Reading Question-generation Using Educational Smart Text Agents)** framework is a hybrid multi-agent system specifically designed for generating cognitively diverse multiple-choice questions [4]. It explicitly targets cognitive diversity in generated artifacts by reflecting differences in the reasoning processes required for a successful response. ReQUESTA employs specialized agents to generate questions across three key cognitive modes:

1.  **Text-based (Recall):** Questions that target explicit factual information. 
    *   *Example Question:* "According to the text, what is the primary function of the Preprocessor agent in ReQUESTA?" [4]
2.  **Inferential:** Questions that require integrating information beyond surface-level recall to draw conclusions. 
    *   *Example Question:* "Based on the ReQUESTA framework, what can be inferred about the challenges of single-pass LLM question generation?" [4]
3.  **Main Idea (Synthesis):** Questions that assess understanding of overarching themes or central arguments. 
    *   *Example Question:* "What is the central argument presented by the ReQUESTA framework regarding controlled question generation?" [4]

ReQUESTA's modular and agentic design demonstrates a practical approach to achieving cognitive diversity in question generation, particularly relevant for automated systems. It highlights the importance of explicitly designing for different cognitive demands to ensure a comprehensive and varied output [4].

## 5. Conclusion

Cognitive diversity among question-generators is a critical determinant of the quality and breadth of downstream ideation. Diverse cognitive styles foster richer idea generation, mitigate biases, and enhance problem-solving capabilities. A direct correlation exists between the diversity of questions asked and the diversity of solutions generated, with frameworks like Bloom's Taxonomy and ReQUESTA providing structured approaches to ensure cognitive breadth in question formulation. Cases where analytical-only question framing constrained creative output underscore the necessity of incorporating varied cognitive modes, including both adaptive and innovative thinking, as well as questions targeting recall, inference, and synthesis. For brainstorming systems, particularly those utilizing isolated subagents, intentionally cultivating cognitive diversity in question generation is paramount for unlocking truly innovative and comprehensive ideation outcomes.
