## Creative Problem Solving (CPS) Model Elements and Idea Symphony Persona Mapping

This section details the mapping of key elements and cognitive roles within the Creative Problem Solving (CPS) model to the 15 Idea Symphony personas. The CPS model, typically comprising four stages—Clarify, Ideate, Develop, and Implement—involves distinct thinking modes, both divergent and convergent, at each step to effectively navigate complex challenges [1].

### CPS Model Overview

The Creative Problem Solving (CPS) model is a structured approach designed to enhance creative thinking and problem-solving capabilities. It emphasizes alternating between divergent thinking (generating many options) and convergent thinking (evaluating and selecting options) throughout the process [1].

**Stages and Key Elements:**

*   **Clarify:** This initial stage focuses on understanding the problem deeply. It involves:
    *   **Explore the Vision:** Identifying the goal, wish, or challenge.
    *   **Gather Data:** Describing and generating information to gain a clear understanding of the challenge.
    *   **Formulate Challenges:** Sharpening awareness of the challenge and framing it as open-ended questions to invite solutions.
    *   **Associated Thinking Modes:** Analytical, exploratory, broad divergent thinking (to explore the problem space), listening, connection, and understanding [1].

*   **Ideate:** In this stage, the focus is on generating a wide range of potential solutions.
    *   **Associated Thinking Modes:** Predominantly divergent thinking, emphasizing quantity over quality, seeking novel ideas, and creating choices. Techniques include brainstorming, random metaphors, oxymorons, and applying constraints to stimulate creativity [1].

*   **Develop:** This stage involves evaluating the generated ideas to find the most promising solutions.
    *   **Associated Thinking Modes:** A combination of divergent (to further explore and refine ideas) and convergent thinking (to evaluate, filter, and select). Key activities include critical analysis, filtering, evaluating, building understanding, refining options, criteria setting, testing, and synthesis [1].

*   **Implement:** The final stage focuses on putting the chosen solution into action.
    *   **Associated Thinking Modes:** Primarily convergent thinking, ensuring feasibility, gaining stakeholder acceptance, and planning necessary activities and resources [1].

### Persona Mapping Table

The following table maps the CPS model's key elements and associated thinking modes to the 15 Idea Symphony personas. A '✓' indicates that a persona aligns with or covers a particular CPS element.

### Uncovered Elements (Gaps) and Criticality Assessment

Based on the mapping, the following CPS elements or thinking modes are not explicitly covered by any of the 15 Idea Symphony personas:

| CPS Element / Thinking Mode | Criticality Assessment (Viable for Isolated Subagent Operation) |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Oxymorons                   | Yes, can be used to generate novel ideas by combining contradictory terms. |

**Gap Count:** 1

**Critical Gaps:** Oxymorons

### Candidate Persona Proposals for Actionable Gaps

For the identified critical gap, "Oxymorons," a new persona concept is proposed:

*   **The Paradoxical Thinker:** This persona specializes in generating novel ideas by intentionally combining contradictory or seemingly incompatible concepts. They would excel at challenging conventional thinking by exploring the creative tension between opposites, leading to unexpected and innovative solutions. This persona would operate in isolation by taking a given concept or problem and applying paradoxical thinking to generate new perspectives or solutions.
