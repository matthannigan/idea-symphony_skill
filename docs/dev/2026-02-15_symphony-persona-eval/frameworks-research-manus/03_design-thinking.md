# Design Thinking Framework Analysis

## 1. Framework Overview

Design Thinking is a human-centered, iterative process for creative problem-solving. It focuses on understanding user needs to develop innovative solutions. The framework consists of five key stages or "modes":

*   **Empathize:** Understanding the user's needs, motivations, and pain points through observation, interaction, and immersion.
*   **Define:** Synthesizing the findings from the Empathize stage to form a clear problem statement or "point of view."
*   **Ideate:** Generating a wide range of creative ideas and potential solutions to the defined problem.
*   **Prototype:** Creating low-fidelity, experimental versions of potential solutions to test and refine ideas.
*   **Test:** Gathering user feedback on the prototypes to iterate and improve the solution.

## 2. Persona Mapping

| Design Thinking Stage | Mapped Idea Symphony Personas |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Empathize** | Audience Advocate, Questioner |
| **Define** | Analyst, Synthesizer, First Principles Thinker |
| **Ideate** | Visionary, Momentum Builder, Analogist, Constraint Flipper, Connector |
| **Prototype** | Pragmatist, Technical Expert |
| **Test** | Devil's Advocate, Audience Advocate |

## 3. Gap Analysis

Based on the mapping, the following gaps have been identified:

*   **Empathize:** While the **Audience Advocate** represents user perspectives, there is no persona dedicated to the *active process* of empathic research, such as conducting user interviews, ethnographic studies, or immersion. The **Questioner** can assist, but their focus is broader than just user empathy.
*   **Define:** The existing personas cover the analytical and synthesis aspects of this stage well.
*   **Ideate:** The generative personas cover this stage comprehensively.
*   **Prototype:** The **Pragmatist** and **Technical Expert** can assess the feasibility of a prototype, but there is no persona focused on the *creative and rapid construction* of low-fidelity prototypes for testing and learning.
*   **Test:** The **Devil's Advocate** can identify flaws, and the **Audience Advocate** can provide feedback from a user perspective. However, there is no persona specifically focused on the *systematic testing and evaluation* of prototypes with users to gather feedback and iterate.

### Viability of Gaps for Isolated Operation

*   **Empathic Researcher (Gap in Empathize):** This is a viable isolated role. A persona focused on empathic research could independently conduct user research and produce a detailed report on user needs, motivations, and pain points. This output would be a valuable asset for the other personas.
*   **Rapid Prototyper (Gap in Prototype):** This is a viable isolated role. A persona focused on rapid prototyping could take a set of ideas and quickly generate multiple low-fidelity prototypes, which could then be used for testing.
*   **User Tester (Gap in Test):** This is a viable isolated role. A persona focused on user testing could take a set of prototypes and a list of user criteria and conduct systematic user testing, producing a report of the findings.

## 4. Candidate Persona Proposals

Based on the gap analysis, the following candidate personas are proposed:

*   **The Ethnographer:** A persona focused on deep, immersive user research to uncover latent needs and unspoken desires. This persona would be an expert in qualitative research methods, such as user interviews, contextual inquiries, and ethnographic studies.
*   **The Maker:** A persona focused on the rapid creation of low-fidelity prototypes to make ideas tangible and testable. This persona would be skilled in various prototyping techniques, from paper prototypes to simple interactive mockups.
*   **The Evaluator:** A persona focused on the systematic testing and evaluation of prototypes with users. This persona would be skilled in user testing methodologies, data analysis, and providing actionable feedback for iteration.
