# TRIZ Inventive Principles Framework Analysis and Idea Symphony Persona Mapping

## 1. Framework Overview and Key Elements

TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) is a systematic methodology developed by Genrich Altshuller, based on the analysis of millions of patents to identify patterns of invention. At its core are the **40 Inventive Principles**, which are generic suggestions for performing actions to overcome technical contradictions and solve problems. These principles offer a structured approach to innovation, moving beyond trial-and-error to systematic problem-solving.

The 40 inventive principles are:

1.  **Segmentation:** Divide an object into independent parts.
2.  **Extraction:** Extract the 'disturbing' part or property from an object.
3.  **Local Quality:** Change an object's structure from uniform to non-uniform, or change an external environment from uniform to non-uniform.
4.  **Asymmetry:** Change the shape of an object from symmetrical to asymmetrical.
5.  **Consolidation:** Combine homogeneous or contiguous objects.
6.  **Universality:** Make a part or object perform multiple functions.
7.  **Nesting (Matrioshka):** Place one object inside another.
8.  **Counterweight:** Compensate for the weight of an object by combining it with another object that provides lift.

## 3. List of Uncovered Elements (Gaps)

While all 40 TRIZ principles are mapped to existing personas, a deeper analysis reveals several nuances and specific thinking patterns that are not fully captured by the current Idea Symphony personas. These represent potential gaps where a dedicated persona could bring unique value operating in isolation.

1.  **Systematic Design for Non-Uniformity/Optimization (from Local Quality):** The current personas cover practicality and technical expertise, but not a dedicated focus on intentionally designing for non-uniformity or optimizing specific local conditions as a primary inventive strategy. This involves a deliberate departure from homogeneity to achieve specific performance gains in localized areas.
2.  **Intentional Asymmetry/Symmetry Breaking (from Asymmetry):** While Visionary might conceive of new forms and Constraint Flipper might use asymmetry to overcome a limitation, there isn't a persona whose core function is to systematically explore and apply asymmetry as a design principle for functional or aesthetic advantage, or to deliberately break existing symmetries.
3.  **Dynamic System Balancing/Counteraction (from Counterweight, Equipotentiality, Prior Counteraction):** While Pragmatist and Devil's Advocate address practical counteractions and risk, there isn't a persona focused on the dynamic and often subtle art of balancing opposing forces, creating equilibrium, or proactively setting up counter-effects within a system. This goes beyond simple risk mitigation to active system stabilization and optimization through counter-measures.
4.  **Geometric/Topological Transformation (from Spheroidality, Transition Into a New Dimension):** Technical Expert and Analyst might understand the geometry, but there isn't a persona dedicated to creatively transforming shapes, dimensions, or spatial arrangements as a primary inventive act. This involves thinking in terms of geometric and topological changes to solve problems.
5.  **Material Science & Property Manipulation (from Porous Material, Flexible Membranes, Transformation of Properties, Phase Transition, Thermal Expansion, Accelerated Oxidation, Inert Environment, Composite Materials):** Technical Expert covers domain-specific knowledge, but the sheer breadth and depth of material science principles in TRIZ suggest a need for a persona focused on deeply understanding and creatively manipulating material properties, states, and environments for inventive solutions. This is more than just applying existing technical knowledge; it's about innovative material application and design.
6.  **Information/Sensory System Integration (from Replacement of Mechanical System, Changing the Color, Feedback):** While Audience Advocate considers user perception and Technical Expert understands systems, there isn't a persona primarily focused on replacing physical interactions with information-based or sensory solutions, or leveraging visual/sensory cues for functional purposes. This involves a shift from purely mechanical thinking to information and perception-driven design.

## 4. Assessment of Critical Gaps for Isolated Subagent Operation

Each of the identified gaps represents a distinct thinking mode that could produce value when operating in isolation as a subagent. The critical constraint is that the missing thinking mode must be able to produce value when operating in isolation on a shared topic.

1.  **Systematic Design for Non-Uniformity/Optimization:** This thinking mode can operate in isolation by analyzing a problem and proposing solutions that involve localized optimization or intentional non-uniformity. It can take a general problem description and suggest specific areas for focused improvement or variation.
2.  **Intentional Asymmetry/Symmetry Breaking:** A persona focused on this could independently analyze a design or problem and suggest ways to introduce asymmetry or break existing symmetries to achieve a desired outcome (e.g., improved stability, unique aesthetics, functional differentiation).
3.  **Dynamic System Balancing/Counteraction:** This persona could analyze a system's interactions and propose proactive balancing mechanisms or counter-actions to prevent issues or optimize performance, without needing real-time interaction with other personas during its ideation phase.
4.  **Geometric/Topological Transformation:** This persona could independently analyze the spatial or structural aspects of a problem and generate ideas based on transforming shapes, dimensions, or arrangements, providing a unique perspective on physical solutions.
5.  **Material Science & Property Manipulation:** A persona specializing in this could analyze a problem and propose solutions based on novel material applications, property changes, or environmental modifications, drawing on a deep understanding of material behavior.
6.  **Information/Sensory System Integration:** This persona could independently analyze how information is conveyed or perceived in a system and propose solutions that leverage sensory input, feedback loops, or non-mechanical interactions to achieve desired outcomes.

All these gaps represent distinct, actionable thinking patterns that can operate in isolation, taking a problem statement and generating specific types of solutions or analyses. Therefore, they are all considered viable for isolated subagent operation.
