## Investigation B24: Politician Final Test

### Key Questions

**1. Vocabulary calibration on space party: Does the Politician produce useful interpersonal dynamics in plain language without institutional political jargon?**

Partially resolved. The four specific B19 examples are largely eliminated, but institutional vocabulary persists in reduced form — concentrated in cluster 03 (logistics-and-safety).

**Banned terms scorecard (space party, all clusters):**

- "pork barrel" — ELIMINATED (v1 had: "The decorations ($60) are your 'pork barrel'")
- "sacred cow" — ELIMINATED (v1 had: "The cake ($50) is your 'sacred cow'")
- "constituent services" — ELIMINATED (v1 had: "Goodie bags ($40) are your 'constituent services'")
- "inauguration ceremony" — ELIMINATED (v1 had: "The cake cutting becomes an 'inauguration ceremony'")
- "legislative session" — STILL PRESENT 1× in cluster 03: "Keeping good relations with your host venue is essential for future legislative sessions (future parties)"
- "voting blocs" — ELIMINATED

**Additional institutional jargon still present in cluster 03:**

- "bribes" applied to extra snacks (03, line 19)
- "political theater" applied to themed food presentation (03, line 51)
- "opposition party" applied to bored children (03, line 39)
- "grievance committee" applied to upset children (03, line 31)
- "emergency powers" applied to schedule flexibility (03, line 69)
- "political credibility" applied to party host (03, line 43)
- "political goodwill" applied to cake investment (03, line 13)

Clusters 01, 02, and 04 are significantly cleaner. Cluster 01 uses "power structure," "council," "sovereignty," and "authority" — lighter terms that map interpersonal dynamics without heavy institutional overlay. Cluster 02 is the cleanest, using practical language about parent roles and activity design. Cluster 04 is moderate, with "stakeholder briefing" and "political intelligence" but no heavy institutional metaphors.

**Interpersonal dynamics content:**

Present in 4/4 clusters (100%, exceeding the ≥75% criterion):
- Cluster 01: Authority mapping (birthday girl as commander, rotating leadership), inclusion design (buddy missions, recognition ambassador), parent recruitment (resource distribution)
- Cluster 02: Parent role structuring (embedded controllers, rotation shifts), energy management (tiered stations, comfort zone ambassadors), activity differentiation by temperament
- Cluster 03: Chain of command, bathroom buddy system, parent volunteer recruitment with defined jurisdictions
- Cluster 04: Peer buddy system, parent stakeholder briefing, community skill mapping, multi-generational connection

No over-correction detected. The interpersonal mapping is substantive and retained at full B19 depth.

**Criterion: ⚠️ PARTIAL.** 4/5 specific banned terms eliminated. Cluster 03 still has ~8 instances of institutional political jargon (down from ~15+ in v1). Clusters 01/02/04 are near-clean. Interpersonal dynamics fully retained.

**2. Technical vs. political discrimination on habit tracker: Does the Politician focus its political lens on genuinely political questions and avoid reframing technical architecture as political negotiations?**

Not resolved. The factional terminology is eliminated, but pervasive political reframing of technical decisions remains.

**Factional language removed (v1 → v2):**

- v1: "the behavioral science faction vs. the scalability caucus" → GONE ✅
- v1: "the feature creep resistance coalition" → GONE ✅
- v1: "the engagement optimizers vs. the notification fatigue resisters" → GONE ✅
- v1: "the marketing team vs. engineering faction dynamic" → GONE ✅

**Pervasive political reframing of engineering decisions persists in cluster 03:**

- "Data model as stakeholder power mapping" — schema design framed as political power
- "Indexing as political power distribution" — database indexes framed as distributing political influence among stakeholder groups
- "Data relationships as governance design" — foreign keys framed as governance gates
- "Schema as coalition-building infrastructure" — completion events table as coalition builder
- "Future-proofing through versioning politics" — schema versioning as governance mechanism
- "Offline support as stakeholder redistribution" — IndexedDB as institutionalized power for users
- "Conflict resolution as political compromise" — sync collision handling as political compromise
- "Battery usage as political negotiation" — sync intervals as resource allocation battles
- "Notification strategy as stakeholder power mapping" — reminder system as formal influence channels
- "MVP scope as political boundary-setting" — architecture scoping as political statement

Count: 10+ instances of reframing purely technical decisions as political negotiations. Criterion was ≤2 instances. NOT MET.

**Business/sustainability cluster (04) maintains full political depth ✅:**

- Monetization as stakeholder alignment: "Advertisements create conflicting incentives — the business would profit from users' failures"
- Growth as coalition-building: "Coalition sequence: influencers first, users second, revenue third"
- Privacy as governance: "Privacy by design as coalition-building strategy... every data point collected creates a new stakeholder relationship"
- Competition as political positioning: "Reposition competitors as potential coalition partners"

This content is genuinely political and represents the Politician's strongest contribution to the habit tracker topic.

**Criterion: ❌ NOT MET.** Factional terminology eliminated (qualitative improvement), but technical architecture cluster still pervasively applies political framing to engineering decisions (≥10 instances vs. ≤2 target). Business/sustainability cluster appropriately strong.

**3. Tool library depth (maintained): Does the Politician still produce full institutional political analysis?**

Yes — maintained at B19 levels with no regression.

**Named stakeholders (new version):** landlords/property owners, city policy makers, mayor's office, local contractors, property managers, renters (with specific 40% figure), churches/community centers/schools, transit authority, hospital and manufacturing HR departments, bilingual community ambassadors, faith leaders (mosques, temples, churches), CDFIs, local hardware stores, city housing department, vocational schools, neighborhood associations.

**Coalition sequences (new version):**
- Tool training → advocacy → leadership pipeline → governance templates (01, lines 47-55)
- Location visibility negotiation → renters' council → tool subsidy → timing leverage → housing authority partnership (03, lines 12-22)
- Expansion via neighborhood association coalitions requiring endorsement from 3 associations (04, line 45)

**Opposition strategies (new version):**
- "Opposition co-option strategy. Identify the loudest critics and offer them governance roles with real power. Converted opponents become your strongest advocates" (03, line 39)
- Landlord-renter tension management through formal counterweight (03, line 15)
- "Truth and reconciliation approach" for past failed projects (03, line 37)

**Governance structures (new version):**
- Renters' council with veto power (03, line 15)
- Reserved board seats for renters, seniors, low-income, immigrants (03, line 61)
- Staggered election cycles preventing capture (03, line 63)
- Advisory councils with decision-making power on specific issues (03, line 65)
- Multi-stakeholder tool selection committee with 4-person weighted influence (02, line 27)
- Digital inclusion task force evaluating tech through equity lens (02, line 63)
- Technology sunset policy with 6-month reviews (02, line 67)

**Criterion: ✅ MET.** All four content types (named stakeholders, coalition sequences, opposition strategies, governance structures) present at comparable depth to B19.

**4. Specificity (maintained): Does every stakeholder mention include interests and engagement strategy?**

Yes — maintained. Spot-check across all three topics found zero instances of generic "get buy-in" advice.

Examples of continued specificity:
- Tool library 01: "landlords protecting resident investment, homeowners avoiding duplicate purchases" (interests) → "natural champions among property owners who control budgets" (engagement)
- Tool library 03: "Hospital and manufacturing plant HR departments control shift worker access" (stakeholder + gatekeeper role) → "Create before/after shift borrowing windows coordinated with shift changes. These employers need community engagement points for their workforce — position this as employee benefit, not charity" (specific deal structure)
- Habit tracker 04: "Coalition sequence: influencers first, users second, revenue third. Start with partnerships with established habit-building influencers who already have trust. Their endorsement gets you initial credibility" (ordered engagement with specific rationale)
- Space party 04: "Parents as embedded mission controllers. Invite parents to sign up for specific roles — 'mission photographer,' 'snack supervisor,' 'activity monitor' — turning potential hovering into structured contribution" (stakeholder + specific role structure)

**Criterion: ✅ MET.**

**5. Distinctiveness (maintained): Highly Distinct vs Lawyer, Audience Advocate, Devil's Advocate?**

Yes — maintained across all three comparisons.

**Politician vs. Lawyer (space party, theme-and-experience):**
- Lawyer: "Pop-up regulatory inspection stations... safety check stations... OSHA workplace safety standards" / "Liability-controlled mission briefings... age-appropriate astronaut training acknowledgments that parents sign"
- Politician: "Mission Control Election. Assign each child a space role... The birthday girl gets 'Commander' title with final decision power" / "Adventure Partnership System. Pair activities as buddy missions where the birthday girl partners with different friends"
- The Lawyer designs compliance frameworks; the Politician designs authority distribution. Zero content overlap.

**Politician vs. Audience Advocate (space party, theme-and-experience):**
- Audience Advocate: "From a child's perspective, the magic lies in feeling like you've truly entered another world" / "Power dynamics: 5-year-olds are acutely aware of fairness"
- Politician: "Balloon Power Structure. Create 'launch authority' — only children with completed mission tasks can activate the balloon launch. The birthday girl holds the launch codes but must delegate tasks to teammates"
- The Audience Advocate represents user needs and emotional experience; the Politician designs the power structure that shapes how those needs get met. Complementary, not overlapping.

**Politician vs. Devil's Advocate (space party, theme-and-experience):**
- Devil's Advocate: "Have we considered that immersive experiences for 5-year-olds often become overwhelming rather than memorable?" / "What's the backup plan when 5-year-olds inevitably deviate from the narrative?"
- Politician: "Space Colony Constitution. Begin with constitutional convention where children create party rules. The birthday girl presides as first citizen but must gain consensus"
- The Devil's Advocate opens inquiry with challenges; the Politician designs engagement strategies. Entirely different cognitive modes.

**Criterion: ✅ MET.** Highly Distinct ratings preserved vs. all three comparison personas.

**6. Coalition sequencing (maintained): Ordered stakeholder engagement sequences present in ≥2 topics?**

Yes — present in all three topics.

- **Tool library:** "Tool training creates political capital for expanded offerings" → "Tool repair workshops build technical capacity that serves broader community needs" → "Strategic partnerships create political momentum for growth" → "Volunteer development tracks political succession planning" → "Governance structures become templates for other community initiatives" (01, lines 47-55)
- **Habit tracker:** "Coalition sequence: influencers first, users second, revenue third. Start with partnerships with established habit-building influencers who already have trust. Their endorsement gets you initial credibility that unlocks broader adoption" (04, line 37)
- **Space party:** Less explicit formal sequencing than the other topics, but cluster 01 contains implicit sequences: birthday girl authority → delegation to teammates → collective achievement celebration

**Criterion: ✅ MET.** Ordered sequences present in ≥2 topics.

### Evidence

**Before/after vocabulary calibration on space party (cluster 03, budget question):**

v1: "The cake ($50) is your 'sacred cow' — untouchable but expected. The decorations ($60) are your 'pork barrel' — visible to all but unnecessary. The projector ($100) is your 'policy win.' Goodie bags ($40) are your 'constituent services' — individual payoffs that build support."

v2: "The birthday girl's experience commands the largest allocation. Invest $120-150 in one transformative centerpiece (planetarium projector or photo booth backdrop) that delivers the 'wow' factor and sets the tone for the entire event. This is the capital investment that generates maximum political goodwill."

Improvement: The explicit labeling of cake as "sacred cow" and goodie bags as "constituent services" is gone. But "political goodwill" for a birthday party centerpiece remains.

**Before/after vocabulary calibration on space party (cluster 03, pacing question):**

v1: "Structure the timeline as a 'legislative session' with clear agenda items. The 2-hour window should have 5 distinct 'bills' to pass: arrival (15 min), main activities (60 min), food (30 min), cake (15 min)... This legislative structure prevents any single item from dominating... 'must-pass legislation.'"

v2: "The 90-minute sweet spot balances attention spans. Structure activities in 15-20 minute segments that progressively build energy before winding down." / "Build flexibility through modular activities. Have optional stations that can be activated or skipped based on real-time performance."

Improvement: The legislative session framing is gone from the pacing question itself. Practical language about timing segments replaces bills/legislation metaphors.

**Before/after technical discrimination on habit tracker (cluster 03, data model):**

v1: "The behavioral science faction vs. the scalability caucus. Your data model serves both researchers wanting granular habit data and operations needing billion-row performance. Create parallel schemas — one optimized for analytics with join-heavy queries, another optimized for fast writes."

v2: "Data model as stakeholder power mapping. Your schema design determines whose interests get prioritized in future feature debates. A habits table with metadata columns (user_id, category, difficulty, streak_weight) creates formal power structures for future feature requests."

Change: The factional caucus naming is eliminated. But the reframing of schema design as "political power mapping" persists. The concrete technical advice (table columns, metadata) is now present but wrapped in political governance language.

**Tool library depth samples confirming no regression:**

New 03 (equity-and-access): "Renters' council seat requirement. Governance bylaws must include two dedicated renters' representatives with veto power over any policy that disproportionately impacts renters. Landlord volunteers on the board will naturally prioritize homeowner concerns; renters need formal counterweight to balance these interests."

New 03 (equity-and-access): "Language access requires political will. Don't just translate materials — recruit bilingual community ambassadors from local cultural centers with stipends. These gatekeepers can explain why sharing tools is culturally appropriate to immigrant communities suspicious of 'borrowing' norms. Their endorsement matters more than translated documents."

Both examples show named stakeholders, specific interests, specific engagement strategies, and governance design — matching B19 depth.

### Recommendation

**Retain** — with acknowledged limitation.

The refinements produced clear directional improvement on both targeted issues:
- Space party: 4/5 specific banned terms eliminated; clusters 01/02/04 substantially cleaner; interpersonal dynamics fully retained
- Habit tracker: Factional caucus language eliminated; qualitative improvement in how technical questions are handled

However, neither issue is fully resolved:
- Space party cluster 03 retains ~8 instances of institutional political vocabulary (down from ~15+)
- Habit tracker cluster 03 still pervasively reframes engineering decisions as political (≥10 instances vs. ≤2 target)

The decision gate maps to the third condition: "institutional vocabulary persists despite the explicit avoid rule." The political framing appears somewhat inherent to the persona's cognitive mode — it sees everything through a power-dynamics lens, including topics where simpler framing would suffice. The refinements successfully eliminated the most egregious examples (sacred cow, pork barrel, inauguration ceremony, factional caucuses) but could not prevent the persona from generating new political metaphors at a lower intensity.

**Retain because:**
1. The tool library — the persona's primary value territory — shows no regression and remains the strongest political analysis in the roster
2. The habit tracker business/sustainability cluster is genuinely political and represents novel, valuable content
3. Interpersonal dynamics mapping on the space party is substantive and retained (no over-correction)
4. All B19 strengths preserved: specificity, distinctiveness, coalition sequencing, governance design
5. The remaining over-application is concentrated in two specific clusters (space party logistics, habit tracker technical architecture) where users can weight or filter the output

**Further refinement is unlikely to resolve the residual issue without risking over-correction** — the political lens is the persona's identity. Softening the opening role description ("map the human politics") might reduce technical over-application but risks flattening the tool library analysis that makes this persona uniquely valuable.

### Notes

- **Cluster 03 is the problem child on both topics.** Space party cluster 03 (logistics-and-safety) and habit tracker cluster 03 (technical-architecture) are where the political over-application concentrates. This may reflect that these clusters deal with operational/technical details where the Politician's lens adds least value — the persona defaults to its strongest cognitive mode when the topic doesn't naturally invite political analysis.
- **The new version produces more ideas per cluster.** v1 space party cluster 01 had 15 responses across 5 questions (3 per question); v2 has 25 responses across 5 questions (5 per question). The expanded output doesn't dilute quality but does create more surface area for occasional over-application.
- **The "avoid" rule works for specific banned examples but not for the underlying tendency.** The prompt refinement successfully prevented the exact B19 examples from recurring. But the persona generated new political metaphors at lower intensity (grievance committee, opposition party, political theater) that weren't in the avoid list. This is a whack-a-mole dynamic — banning specific terms doesn't address the cognitive pattern.
- **The habit tracker technical cluster is the largest remaining gap.** Every single idea in cluster 03 reframes an engineering decision as a political negotiation. While some of these contain genuinely useful stakeholder analysis embedded within the political framing (e.g., "tech stack decisions create alignment or friction between user needs, business goals, and technical constraints"), the framing-to-content ratio remains heavily skewed toward political metaphor. This cluster's value would increase if the persona could identify which technical decisions genuinely involve human interests (many do) versus which are purely engineering tradeoffs (some are).
- **Success criteria scorecard: 4/6 fully met, 2/6 partially met.** (1) Vocabulary calibration: ⚠️ partial — significant improvement but not zero instances. (2) Technical discrimination: ❌ not met — factional terminology gone but pervasive reframing persists. (3) Tool library depth: ✅ maintained. (4) Specificity: ✅ maintained. (5) Distinctiveness: ✅ maintained. (6) Coalition sequencing: ✅ maintained.
