# Investigation B22: Futurist Final Test

**Date:** 2026-02-18
**Persona under test:** The Futurist (second refinement)
**Source:** B16 Futurist Retest — Conditional Retain with two targeted refinements

---

## Purpose

Re-run the Futurist with its second-round refined prompt and assess whether the three issues identified in B16 are resolved. B16 found meaningful improvement over the original but fell short on three metrics. Two targeted prompt refinements have been applied:

1. **Technical Expert boundary** — The prompt now explicitly prohibits proposing specific technology implementations, architecture decisions, or tech stacks. The Futurist should focus on *what capabilities to invest in and when*, not *how to build them*. This targets the 35-40% Technical Expert overlap on tech topics (B16 §6).

2. **Citation quality** — The prompt now requires directional language ("growing," "declining," "accelerating") when specific data is unavailable and explicitly prohibits fabricating statistics. Examples were updated to model this (e.g., "a growing majority of US cities" instead of "78% of US cities"). This targets the systematic fabrication of precise-but-unverifiable statistics (B16 §1 quality concern, B16 Evidence §Fabricated Citation Pattern).

3. **Temporal-lens anti-pattern** (bonus) — A new avoid rule was added: "Simply adding a trend citation to an otherwise common idea — your ideas should be *generated by* trend analysis, not decorated with it." This directly targets the ~30-35% temporal-lens reframing rate (B16 §3).

## Key Questions

1. **Citation quality:** Has the fabricated-statistics problem decreased? Count ideas using directional language vs. ideas citing suspiciously precise unverifiable numbers. Target: <20% of citations use unverifiable specific statistics (down from ~80% in B16).
2. **Citation compliance (maintained):** Does the Futurist still anchor ideas in trends despite the relaxed precision requirement? Target: >80% (B16 achieved ~95%; verify the directional-language shift doesn't collapse back to vague "as X evolves" framing).
3. **Technical Expert overlap:** Has the explicit boundary reduced overlap on technology-heavy topics? Target: <20% overlap on tech topics (down from 35-40% in B16). Look specifically at habit-tracker architecture ideas — B16 found near-identical proposals (event-sourcing, PWA, service workers, containerized services).
4. **Temporal lens overlap:** Has the anti-decoration rule reduced temporal-lens reframing? Target: <25% (B16 predicted this achievable; stretch target remains <20%). Count ideas that are essentially other personas' ideas with a trend citation stapled on.
5. **Unique ideas (maintained):** Does the Futurist still produce 4-6 unique ideas per topic? Verify the tech-boundary constraint hasn't removed unique infrastructure-readiness ideas — some B16 unique ideas (e.g., "API-first backend," "event-sourcing data model," "containerized microservice boundaries") were themselves tech implementations that should now be excluded.
6. **Infrastructure-readiness thinking (maintained):** Does this distinctive capability survive the tech-implementation boundary? Infrastructure-readiness should manifest as *strategic positioning* ("invest in integration capability with municipal systems") rather than *architecture specification* ("build an API-first backend"). Target: clearly present in 2+ topics in strategic form.
7. **Visionary convergence:** Has the ~21% average from B16 decreased? Target: <20% (relaxed from B16's <15% given marginal miss). Focus on tool-library and habit-tracker topics where B16 was near-target.
8. **Full roster distinctiveness:** Has the combination of reduced Technical Expert overlap and reduced temporal-lens reframing pushed distinctiveness to Moderate? Target: Moderate (up from Low-to-Moderate in B16).

## Expected Outcome

The second-refinement Futurist should:
- Use directional trend language instead of fabricated precise statistics
- Avoid proposing specific technology implementations, creating a clear boundary with the Technical Expert
- Generate ideas *from* trend analysis rather than decorating common ideas with trend citations
- Maintain high unique-idea volume and infrastructure-readiness thinking in strategic (not architectural) form
- Achieve Moderate distinctiveness against the full analytical roster

## Success Criteria

- Fabricated-statistic rate: <20% of citations (down from ~80%)
- Trend citation compliance: >80% of ideas anchored in trends (maintained)
- Technical Expert overlap: <20% on tech topics (down from 35-40%)
- Temporal lens overlap: <25% (down from 30-35%; stretch: <20%)
- Unique ideas: 4-6 per topic (maintained; expect some shift from tech-specific to strategy-specific ideas)
- Infrastructure-readiness thinking: present in 2+ topics in strategic form
- Visionary convergence: <20% (down from ~21%)
- Full roster distinctiveness: Moderate (up from Low-to-Moderate)

## Decision Gate

**If Moderate distinctiveness is achieved:** Retain the Futurist with the current prompt. The persona has demonstrated genuine generative value through three rounds of refinement.

**If distinctiveness remains below Moderate despite two rounds of refinement:** This confirms B11's structural finding — the Futurist's temporal-lens mode is inherent, not correctable through prompt engineering. Execute B11's fallback: retire the Futurist and absorb infrastructure-readiness thinking into the Technical Expert prompt. No further retests.
