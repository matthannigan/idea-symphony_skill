# Idea Symphony and Idea Factory: Phase 1 Initiation Improvements

Let's discuss continued improvements to Idea Symphony and Idea Factory. I specifically want to talk about the Phase 1 initiation step for both skills. I'd like to update the Orchestrator instructions to provide additional options to the user regarding the feedback they might offer during both phases.

## Idea Symphony Updates: User-Defined Questions

We can talk about Idea Symphony first. I'd like to include a set of questions that the user has already identified that they want answered, so that can feed into the Phase 2 question brainstorming and synthesis process.

In addition to whatever request file or prompt is provided, if the user has specific questions they would like the brainstorm to answer or investigate, they should be able to specify those as part of the initiation.

### Handling User Questions in Phase 2

If the user provides this information, it shouldn't necessarily be made known to the question generation agents during **Phase 2a**, but it should be preserved during the question synthesis in **Phase 2b**. To the greatest extent possible, the user's prompted questions must be preserved. Even if the number of questions exceeds the recommended amount due to the user's additions, those questions should persist.

However, if a user question should be synthesized with other related questions generated by a persona, that is acceptable. For example, if a user's question mirrors something the "First Principles Thinker" already asked, those questions should be combined. We just want to ensure, from a quality gate standpoint, that the user's original intent persists in the final questions list at the end of Phase 2b.

**Required Instruction Changes:**

1. **Process:** Ask whether the user has specific questions they want the brainstorming process to answer.
2. **Synthesis:** Ensure user questions are part of the Phase 2b synthesis.
3. **Quality Gate:** At the end of Phase 2, check that if the user specified questions in advance, those questions persisted after synthesis occurred.

### Implementation for "Low Effort" Mode

There is a catch regarding the "Low Effort" setting. If the user provides questions they want answered but chooses the low effort setting, we may need a hybrid approach. Currently, low effort does not include a synthesis step.

To address this, we could tweak the prompt for the generic question generator persona. We could create a **"Generic Question Generator with User Questions"** prompt. This persona would be asked to generate questions as usual, but would also be given the user's questions with instructions to preserve, expand, and revise them. This puts the synthesis into the generation request rather than requiring a separate synthesis phase.

Alternatively, we could treat the user's questions as an additional persona input—like a "3+1" or "5+1" circumstance for medium and high runs—to ensure they fit into the mix.

## Idea Factory Updates: Defining Output Format

As it relates to Idea Factory, I want to shape how the initial processing occurs. Here, the focus is on understanding what the desired output should be at the final step.

I tested examples during development where I just provided a general prompt, and an action plan emerged. I also tested examples where I tried to steer the Orchestrator to develop the plan in a specific way. I see a clear use case where a revision and expansion of a pre-existing document is the primary goal.

### Two Potential Output Shapes

The Orchestrator should clarify at the beginning of Phase 1 whether the user has a document they are looking to improve. The output could then take two shapes:

1. **Revised and Expanded Document:** A version 2.0 of the submitted material, written based on the best recommendations from the brainstorming process.
2. **Recommendations for Improvement:** A strategic analysis or memorandum listing things to do to improve the original submission, without actually rewriting the document itself.

Currently, most prompts have yielded the "Recommendations" output. I haven't yet succeeded in separating the brainstorm and factory process to produce a true "Version 2.0" document. I need to work on a prompt that focuses the process on an actual revision, not just recommendations for a revision.

### Orchestrator Logic

If the user doesn't have a specific output in mind, the Orchestrator could suggest these different forms. This Phase 1 work would help the Phase 2 outline development.

**Clarifying Questions:**

* Do you have something you want revised or expanded?
* Do you want recommendations (like a strategic approach memorandum)?
* Do you want the revised document itself (where recommendations are implemented)?
* *Note:* The reality might be that both outputs should happen—a recommendation document providing the path forward, and a "best crack" at the revised document.

### Example: The Space Birthday Party

In the case of the "Five-Year-Old Space Birthday Party," the action plan developed using the generic prompt was close to what I hoped for. It worked well because the initial prompt was extraordinarily light (just the concept), so there was no document to revise. The action plan effectively became the primary document.

I would like to see that success persist, but with the ability for the user to steer the course of action.

## Summary of Next Steps

I need to figure out the prompt that allows the Phase 4 synthesis agent in Idea Factory to create a revised version of a document suitable for sharing on its own—one that doesn't refer to the brainstorming or factory process, but simply *is* the updated program plan.

Ideally, these requirements would be handled via questions the Orchestrator asks the user. If necessary, I can provide a template for users to complete in advance if the dynamic questioning isn't yielding good results.

**Action Items:**

1. **Idea Symphony:** Implement logic to ingest and preserve user-defined questions through the synthesis phase (or via modified prompts in Low Effort mode).
2. **Idea Factory:** Update the Orchestrator to determine if the user wants a strategic recommendation list or a tangible document revision, and refine the prompts to enable the latter.
