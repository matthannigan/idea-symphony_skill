# Idea Symphony Status and "Part Two" Concept Notes

## Current Progress on Idea Symphony

I have made some early progress on the **Idea Symphony** skill. I recently revised **Phase 2** to make the question generation process more accurate, and I am going to work on the synthesis process next in **Phase 4**. **Phase 3** seems to be producing adequate results; the most important aspect of Phase 3 is ensuring the right personae are selected for the core brainstorming activity.

## Proposal for a New "Part Two" Skill

I would like to move to a much larger second part of the Idea Symphony process. This will likely be captured as a distinct new skill. I do not have a name for it yet, but I might make it something that complements the concepts of Idea Symphony.

### The Core Concept

In the current Idea Symphony process, brainstorming occurs based on initial user input—for example, a general request like "I'm interested in creating a garden on a vacant lot in my neighborhood," or a set of documents for an initial program plan. The process goes through phases to generate questions and responses, then synthesizes and summarizes those results.

I would like to figure out how to convert the brainstorming response—which currently consists of potential ways of answering different questions—into a newly revised program plan with alternative approaches based on that content. The user would end up with a new approach and different paths to pursue, rather than just a set of answered questions.

### Integration of Agent Teams

I would like to use the new **Agent Teams** approach that Anthropic just released for Claude Code in this process.

* **Current State:** In the Idea Symphony skill, sub-agents respond in a classical approach where context isolation allows for independent thought, but there is no communication between sub-agents.
* **New State:** The new Agent Teams system allows agents to talk to one another, discuss ideas, and work together.

My idea for testing this approach involves giving a set of agents different parts of the brainstorming responses—probably by topic area—and asking them to create a revised project plan that presents alternatives.

### Persona and Orchestration

I am thinking of developing personae that are specific to the task at hand, rather than reusing the brainstorming personae. For instance, if the topic area is marketing or community engagement, perhaps three teammates are spawned to address different aspects of that program design.

The Orchestrator or Team Lead would determine who the agents should be based on the topic being brainstormed. We could potentially build a library of prompts for these agents over time. I would use the internal messaging queue and other parts of the Agent Teams approach to ensure the agents can have a conversation about a topic area. The goal would be to produce an action plan for the project in that topic area, pivoting from "brainstorming questions and responses" to "choosing the best ones to develop a new plan."

### Alternative Implementation Approaches

1. **Interpretation and Debate:** Specialized agents (e.g., a Marketing Expert) could look at the summary content and produce their own interpretation of the brainstorming notes. Then, a final reckoning could occur where these independent voices bring their analyses into a conversation and "fight it out."
2. **Orchestrator-Led Outline:** The Orchestrator could look at the original request and the brainstormed topics, develop a new outline for the revised document, and then convene teams to focus on specific portions of that outline.

We need to verify if the Agent Team approach actually produces higher quality results than simply using a sophisticated model to look at team reports.

## Considerations for Revision and Scope

It is important to clarify what the revised product will be and gain agreement from the user.

* **Distinguishing Core Content vs. Context:** If I submit an initial idea along with supplementary materials (e.g., the *Sprout Fund Field Guide for Catalytic Funding*), I need to clarify that I want revisions on the initial idea (e.g., the *Fred Rogers/Andy Warhol* grant program), not the supplementary guide. The Orchestrator needs to intelligently examine documents to determine which requires revision and which serves as background context.
* **Scope Management:** A good example is a previous "Tree of Life" session. The brainstorming summary suggested a hackathon was the wrong approach and proposed a fellowship structure instead. If handed off to a "Part Two" agent, it might create a project plan far afield from the original proposal, spending tokens on something out of scope.
* **Scaling:** The revision process should ideally address scaling—what if there were more resources? What if there were fewer? It would be useful to identify the most important alternatives to pursue first, followed by options available if more time or money becomes available.

## Next Steps

I am excited about the idea of Agent Teams. I want to make sure it is practically useful. I need to determine if we can build a library of agent personae or if they need to be crafted automatically. I also like the idea that as the agent operates, it documents the personae it creates and encourages the user to incorporate them into the skill for future runs.

This will be a separate skill in the Idea Symphony family, specifically designed to execute after brainstorming results have been reviewed or slightly edited by the user.
